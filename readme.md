Passive indoor sensing using machine learning. This program runs on MATLAB. It detects the movement and position of a person in an indoor environment

The project is based on using two routers (router1 and router2) to determine the position of a person. The position is determined to be either close to router 1, router 2, or in between the two routers.

Training data is obtained in a 60-second time window for 10 minutes for each router position with constant and variable distances and directions using 7 individuals.

The signal obtained from the two routers detect human presence in the environment.

THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED FOR SECURITY PURPOSE IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT.
