**Passive indoor sensing using  machine learning**
This programme runs on matlab
It detects the movement and position of a person in an indoor environment

The project is based on using two routers (router1 and router2) to determine
the posiTion of a person. The postion is determined to be either close to router 1,
router 2, or in between the two routers.

A series of data is obtained in a 60sec time window for 10 minutes for training the experiment.

Human presence in the environmentis detected by the signal obtained form the two routers.

THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED FOR SECURITY PURPOSE IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT.
