Passive indoor sensing using  machine learning
This programme runs on matlab
It detects the movement and position of a person in an indoor environment

The project is based on using two routers (router1 and router2) to determine
the position of a person. The postion is determined to be either close to router 1,
router 2, or in between the two routers.

A series of training data is obtained in a 60sec time window for 10 minutes for each router position with constant and variable distances using 7 individuals for training the experiment.

Human presence in the environmentis detected by the signal obtained form the two routers.

THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED FOR SECURITY PURPOSE IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT.
